# Quantitative Analysis

## Namespace

NameNode maintains the directory tree for HDFS and a mapping of file blocks to DataNodes where the data is stored. Similar to the traditional stand-alone file system, the directory structure of HDFS is also a tree structure. HDFS Namespace stores all the attributes of each directory/file node in the directory tree, including: name, number (id), user, group, permission, modification time, access time, subdirectory/file (children) and other information which exist in the Namenode's memory at runtime.
