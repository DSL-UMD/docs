# Deploy Database Systems

Currently, our system provides technical support to some open source database systems such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Cockroach](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach), [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb) and [YugaByte](https://github.com/YugaByte/yugabyte-db). It's also designed to be easily integrate distributed databases within the enterprise as long as they are compatible with PostgreSQL or MySQL. For example,Google's [Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/), Amazon's [Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/?nc1=h_ls) and Microsoft Azure's [Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/).
