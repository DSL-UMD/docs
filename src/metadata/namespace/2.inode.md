# INode

INode is a base class containing common fields for file and directory inodes. The relationships among INode ([INode.java#L62](https://github.com/DSL-UMD/hadoop-calvin/blob/trunk/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/namenode/INode.java#L62), [INodeWithAdditionalFields.java#L98-L124](https://github.com/DSL-UMD/hadoop-calvin/blob/6c852f2a3757129491c21a9ba3b315a7a00c0c28/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/namenode/INodeWithAdditionalFields.java#L98-L124)), INodeFile ([INodeFile.java#L251-L253](https://github.com/DSL-UMD/hadoop-calvin/blob/6c852f2a3757129491c21a9ba3b315a7a00c0c28/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/namenode/INodeFile.java#L251-L253)) and INodeDirectory ([INodeDirectory.java#L74](https://github.com/DSL-UMD/hadoop-calvin/blob/6c852f2a3757129491c21a9ba3b315a7a00c0c28/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/namenode/INodeDirectory.java#L74)) are defined as follows:

**Note:** You can only see these fields at `truck` branch of our github repo: [DSL-UMD/hadoop-calvin](https://github.com/DSL-UMD/hadoop-calvin), since the default branch `calvin` removed them into database.


```java
public abstract class INode implements INodeAttributes, Diff.Element<byte[]> { {
    /** The parent inode id. */
    long parent;
}

public abstract class INodeWithAdditionalFields extends INode {
  /** The inode id. */
  final private long id;
  /**
   *  The inode name is in java UTF8 encoding; 
   *  The name in HdfsFileStatus should keep the same encoding as this.
   *  if this encoding is changed, implicitly getFileInfo and listStatus in
   *  clientProtocol are changed; The decoding at the client
   *  side should change accordingly.
   */
  private byte[] name = null;
  /** 
   * Permission encoded using {@link PermissionStatusFormat}.
   * Codes other than {@link #clonePermissionStatus(INodeWithAdditionalFields)}
   * and {@link #updatePermissionStatus(PermissionStatusFormat, long)}
   * should not modify it.
   */
  private long permission = 0L;
  /** The last modification time*/
  private long modificationTime = 0L;
  /** The last access time*/
  private long accessTime = 0L;

  /** For implementing {@link LinkedElement}. */
  private LinkedElement next = null;
  /** An array {@link Feature}s. */
  private static final Feature[] EMPTY_FEATURE = new Feature[0];
  protected Feature[] features = EMPTY_FEATURE;
}

public class INodeDirectory extends INodeWithAdditionalFields
    implements INodeDirectoryAttributes {
    List<INode> children;   // INode's children list
}

public class INodeFile extends INodeWithAdditionalFields
    implements INodeFileAttributes, BlockCollection {
   // header = 64 bits = storagePolicy(4)
   //                  + BLOCK_LAYOUT_AND_REDUNDANCY(12)
   //                  + preferredBlockSize(48)
   long header;
   BlockInfo[] blocks;
}
```

The following figure shows the class diagram of `INode` in Namespace. From the class diagram, both `INodeFile` and `INodeDirectory` inherits from the INode class. The directory is represented by the INodeDirectory object in memory, and `List<INode> children` is used to describe subdirectories or files in the directory; File is represented by the INodeFile object in memory, and `BlockInfo[] blocks` is used to indicate which blocks of the file are composed.

We will store almost all their attributes into database system and replace the corresponding functions with our database-based implementation.
