# INode Metadata

When clients send requests for file operations (mkdir, create, open, rename, delete) through [ClientProtocol](https://github.com/gangliao/hadoop-calvin/blob/36471ed4e9c25a5e92f48f8ff6602309e217cfc4/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/protocol/ClientProtocol.java#L63-L68)'s RPCs, after Namenode receives requests from clients, it will forward them to the `FSNameSystem` and `FSDirectory` to proceed. Both of them are managing the state of the namespace.
