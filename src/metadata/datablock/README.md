# Datablock Management

We introduced that all inodes and data block indexes in HDFS Namespace will be serialized into FSImage file and persisted on Namenode's hard drive eventually (See [Section 2.1](https://dsl-umd.github.io/docs/intro/hdfs.html#persistence)). However, the relation between data blocks and Datanode haven't been stored in FSImage. In contrast, it's dynamically constructed from the heartbelt of Datanode. No matter where the relations of `INode <-> data block indexes` and `data block <-> Datanode` were before, they can be stored through the database.
